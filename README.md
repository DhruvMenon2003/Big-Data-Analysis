# Big-Data-Analysis

I have solved 3 key problems in Big Data Analytics from fields like evolutionary biology, computer science and econometrics. 
For example, I ran a multiple linear regression model to figure out whether there was a correlation between stunting in children in Myanmar with factors like family income, toilet facility type, main source of drinking water etc..and I inferred from the data that there is a correlation with these factors. So the big idea is that data analysis performed on these real world problems can be a driver for policy change.
