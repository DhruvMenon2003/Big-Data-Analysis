# Big-Data-Analysis

I have solved 3 key problems in Big Data Analytics from fields like evolutionary biology, computer science and econometrics. 
Econometrics: I ran a multiple linear regression model to figure out whether there was a correlation between stunting in children in Myanmar with factors like family income, toilet facility type, main source of drinking water etc..and I inferred from the data that there is a correlation with these factors. So the big idea is that data analysis performed on these real world problems can be a driver for policy change. 
Evolutionary Biology: . These results obtained from the study do not provide support for lifespan extension under Dietary Restriction being a side effect of benign laboratory conditions. The implications for human beings are exploring how aging can be extended naturally through lifestyle changes.Dietary restriction (DR), the limitation of a particular nutrient or the overall caloric intake without malnutrition, has been shown to extend lifespan and delay aging across a range of organisms
